# Hey, I am Alex Yu 😎

## About Me 😀
I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto, with a focus on mathematics, economics, and statistics. I enjoy working on projects and conducting self-research in these fields for fun. My academic journey has endowed me with a robust analytical foundation and a keen interest in decoding intricate data structures.

I aim to seamlessly integrate statistical methodologies with economic and finance frameworks. Driven by a vision to apply mathematical theories to real-world economic phenomena, I am earnestly exploring opportunities that will allow me to collaboratively innovate, challenge conventional paradigms, and contribute to knowledge intersections between these fields.

As I progress through my academic and professional journey, I welcome connections with industry leaders, researchers, and enthusiasts who share a similar zest for these disciplines. Together, we can harness the power of mathematics to craft compelling narratives in the economic landscape.
